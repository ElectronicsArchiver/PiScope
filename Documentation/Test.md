# Dry Test

In case you don't own a Raspberry Pi or ADS1015 yet, but want to see the library in action, I have included a dry test example, which doesn't require any hardware. You can simply run it on any Linux/Windows platform.

Use example_drytest.py available with the repository.

```sh
$ python example_drytest.py
```
